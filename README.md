# vessel_predictions-using-FFNN
Welcome to the repository for the Vessel Predictions project! This project leverages feedforward neural networks to enhance the operational efficiency and reliability of maritime vessels. Our model predicts key aspects such as predictive maintenance needs, excess energy consumption, and estimated time of arrival (ETA), providing valuable insights for vessel management and operation.
Key Features
Predictive Maintenance:
Objective: Forecast potential whether the vessel is in good condition.
Benefits: To know the condition of the vessel.
Excess Energy Consumption Prediction:
Objective: To identify the excess energy to be consumed.
Benefits: Helps in optimizing fuel consumption and planning the fuel consumption.
Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA):
Objective: Accurately predict the time of journey.
Benefits: Improves scheduling efficiency.
